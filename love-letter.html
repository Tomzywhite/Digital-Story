                My Dearest Olivia,

                It all started when I met you on Walkie-Talkie, I knew you were a special person . Funny how we had already spoken before the day I took things further. That had to be one of my luckiest experiencesâ€”meeting the same person twice on different frequencies. I give God all the glory for giving us a second chance to meet and talk.

                Thinking back to the day I asked the question, I remember how nervous I was, but I knew I had to make a move before it was too late. And Iâ€™m really glad I did. I still remember, just one week into the relationship, how you werenâ€™t sure about long-distance relationships. You wanted to be just friends, but I couldnâ€™t agree to thatâ€”I knew how hard it would be for me. Yet, here we are, five months in. It still amazes me how much has changed since we came together.
                
                As I write this, my heart is overflowing with love and admiration for you. You are my princess, my museâ€”you make everything beautiful just by being in it. I deeply admire your kindness, strength, and the way you light up my world. No distance, no challenge, no obstacle can ever diminish the love I have for you. Whether we are near or far, know that you are always in my thoughts, my heart, and my dreams.
                
                You have become my safe place, my reason to smile, and my greatest joy. I look forward to the many adventures weâ€™ll take together, the laughter weâ€™ll share, and the memories weâ€™ll create. I am excited for our future and the endless possibilities ahead of us.
                
                Until the day I can hold you close and tell you all this in person, just know that you are loved beyond measureâ€”you mean the world to me.
                
                Forever yours,
                Tommy
            </p>
