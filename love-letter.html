                My Dearest Olivia,

From the very first moment we connected, I knew you were someone extraordinary. As I sit here writing this letter, my heart overflows with love and admiration for you. You are my princess, my muse, the one who makes everything in life more beautiful simply by being in it.

Every smile you give, every laugh we share, every quiet moment we spend together, feels like a cherished memory in the making. I am in awe of your kindness, your strength, and the way you light up my world with just your presence. There is a magic in the way you love, a warmth in your spirit that I can’t help but be drawn to.

When I think about all the moments we've had, and the ones still to come, I can't help but feel so incredibly lucky. You’ve taught me what it means to truly care, to love without reservation, and to appreciate the little things in life that make us happy.

No distance, no challenge, no obstacle can ever diminish the love I have for you. Whether we are near or far, know that you are always in my thoughts, my heart, and my dreams. You have become my safe place, my reason for smiling, and my greatest joy.

I look forward to the many more adventures we’ll take together, the laughter we’ll share, and the memories we’ll create. I am excited for our future, for the endless possibilities we have ahead of us.

Until the day I can hold you close and tell you all this in person, just know that you are loved beyond measure, and you mean the world to me.

Forever yours,
TOMMY
